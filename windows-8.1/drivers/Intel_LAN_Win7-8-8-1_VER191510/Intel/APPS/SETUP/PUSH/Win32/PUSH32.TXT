Introduction
================================================================================

A "Push", or unattended installation provides a means for network administrators
to easily install a Microsoft Windows* operating system on similarly equipped 
systems. The network administrator can create a bootable media that will 
automatically log into a central server and install the operating system from an 
image of the Windows installation directory stored on that server. This 
document provides instructions for a basic unattended installation that includes 
the installation of drivers for Intel(R) Networking Devices. 

As part of the unattended installation, you can create Teams and VLANs. If you 
wish to create one or more team/VLANs as part of the unattended installation, 
you must also follow the instructions in the "Instructions for Creating Teams 
and VLANs (Optional)" section of this document. 

Supported operating systems are:
- Microsoft Windows* 7
- Microsoft Windows 8
- Microsoft Windows 8.1

NOTE: Intel(R) 10GbE Network Adapters do not support unattended driver 
installation.

================================================================================

Setting up an Install Directory on the File Server
================================================================================

The server must be setup with a distribution folder that holds the required 
Windows files. Clients must also be able to read this folder when connecting 
via TCP/IP or IPX.

For illustration purposes, the examples in this document use the network share 
D:\WINPUSH. To create this share:

1) Create a directory on the server, (EX: D:\WINPUSH).
2) Use the My Computer applet to locate the D:\WINPUSH folder.  
3) Right-click the folder and select Sharing. Select Share this folder. 
4) Give it a share name (EX: WINPUSH). This share name will be used to connect 
   to this directory from the remote target systems.   
5) Adjust permissions as necessary and click OK.  

================================================================================

Instructions for Creating Teams and VLANs (Optional)
================================================================================

If you wish to create teams/VLANS as part of the unattended installation, you need
to create a configuration file with the team/VLAN information in it. To create
this file you need a sample system that has the same type of adapter(s) that will
be in the systems receiving the push installation. On the sample system, use 
Intel(R) PROSet for Windows Device Manager to set up the adapters in the 
team/VLAN configuration you want.

1) Prepare the distribution folder on the file server as detailed in the following 
   section.
2) Copy SavResDX.vbs from the Intel CD to the configured system. The file is 
   located in the APPS\WMI\ directory on the Intel CD. 
3) Open a command prompt on the configured system and navigate to the 
   directory containing SavResDX.vbs. 
4) Run the following command: cscript SavResDX.vbs save. A configuration file 
   called WmiConf.txt is created in the same directory. 
5) Copy the SavResDX.vbs and WmiConf.txt files to the $OEM$\$1\WMIScr directory on 
   the file server.  
6) Locate the batch file, Install.bat, in $OEM$\$1\WMIScr.  Edit the batch 
   file by removing the comment that preceeds the second START command.
   The file should look like the follow when finished:
   
   Start /wait %systemdrive%\drivers\net\INTEL\APPS\ProsetDX\Win32\DXSetup.exe /qn /li %temp%\PROSetDX.log
   REM Uncomment the next line if VLANs or Teams are to be installed.
   Start /wait /b cscript %systemdrive%\wmiscr\SavResDX.vbs restore %systemdrive%\wmiscr\wmiconf.txt > %systemdrive%\wmiscr\output.txt
   exit

Push Instructions
================================================================================

To prepare the distribution folder:

1) Copy the entire contents from the Windows Install DVD to D:\WINPUSH. Use Windows 
   Explorer or XCOPY to maintain the same directory structure as on the 
   Windows Install DVD. When the copy is complete, the Windows installation 
   files should be in the D:\WINPUSH directory. 
2) Use the Windows System Image Manager to edit/generate the Unattend.xml file and 
   save it to the D:\WINPUSH directory.
3) Create the driver install directory structure and copy the driver files 
   to it. 

Example: From a Windows command prompt where e: is the drive letter of 
your CDROM drive: 
 e:
 cd \APPS\SETUP\PUSH 
	(you must be in the APPS\SETUP\PUSH\ directory to run PUSHCOPY)
 pushcopy D:\WINPUSH [WIN8]

The above command creates the $OEM$ directory structure and copy all the 
necessary files to install the driver and Intel(R) PROSet for Windows Device 
Manager. However, Intel(R) PROSet for Windows Device Manager is not installed 
unless the FirstLogonCommands is added as seen in the example below.

[Microsoft-Windows-Shell-Setup\FirstLogonCommands\SynchronousCommand]
CommandLine= %systemdrive%\WMIScr\Install.bat
Description= Begins silent unattended install of Intel PROSet for Windows Device Manager
Order= 1

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Deployment methods
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Boot using your WinPE 2.0 media and connect to the server containing your Windows
installation share. 

Run the command from the \\Server\WINPUSH prompt: 
	setup /unattend:<full path to answer file> 

NOTE: In the above procedure, setup runs the installation in unattended mode 
and also detects the plug and play network adapters. All driver files are 
copied from the shared directory to the target system directories and 
installation of the OS and Network Adapters continues without user 
intervention. 

If you installed VLANs as part of the unattended installation, view the 
results of the script execution in the output.txt file. This file is in 
the same directory as the SavResDX.vbs file.
